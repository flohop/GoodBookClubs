<div class="about-me">
    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Florian Hoppe and I am the creator of this little website you're currently on.
    I developed this site in my spare time, while simultaneously graduating from school.
    I started coding around 4 years ago and haven't stopped since. About 2 years ago I
    started with Python, the language in which this site is written.
    I really enjoyed creating the goodbookclubs, because it allowed me to apply what I already knew,
    and learn a bunch of cool new stuff. If you want to learn more about me,
    check out my <a href="http://florianhoppe.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">other website:</a>

<div class="about-site">
    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>This website is for everyone who likes books. You can share your progress on a book,
        discuss certain books, or talk about a whole genre! You can add new books and create new clubs.
        This site is a work in progress and I'm planning on adding new features over time.
        If you want a feature, or find a bug that's annoying you, feel free to let me know,
        I'd love to get your feedback. You can contact me under <span class="red">hoppe.florian2002@gmail.com</span>.</p>

<div class="about-data">
    <h1 class="red">About your data</h1>
    <p>If you've read the previous sections on this page, you have probably figured out by now,
        that this is a one man project, created by an 18-year-old in the attic of his parents
        . And I don't have any interest, or any use for your data. The only thing this website knows about you,
        is your username, the clubs your're in, and the books you've read. I will not do anything with that data.
        I wonÂ’t sell it or give it to anyone! I am doing my best to protect the little data I have about you,
        but because I'm not a professional, please don't enter any sensitive data on this site because I can't
        guarantee to 100% that I will be able to protect it from any attacks.</p>

    <h1 class="red">About the vector art</h1>
    <p>The beautiful images you saw on the landing page and the logo of this website where not created by me,
        I only changed the color on some of them. The folks at freepik.com & flaticon.com are kind enough to let me use these images
        for free. Below I want to credit the creators of these works of art.</p>
